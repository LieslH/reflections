What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden .git file that contains all the meta data to allow it to be a git repository. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the intermediary between the two and contains files added to it that you plan to commit to the repository. It allows multiple files to be committed at the same time??
