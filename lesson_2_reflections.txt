What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden .git file that contains all the meta data to allow it to be a git repository. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the intermediary between the two and contains files added to it that you plan to commit to the repository. It allows multiple files to be committed at the same time??


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can save (or "add") each logical change you make to the staging area first and then commit all in one commit command (rather than doing a commit every time you make a change) - saves time??


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are useful when you want to try out a new experimental feature for example (but just testing/playing around with it so don't want to make any definite changes. They're also uesful when wanting to, for example, create a different version, but still keep the original in tact (e.g. different language, easy-mode)
